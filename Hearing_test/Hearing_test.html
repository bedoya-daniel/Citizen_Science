          The purpose of this hearing test is to evaluate your ability to hear sound over different intensities and frequencies, and the ability of your hardware to reproduce those sounds. <br>
          When you click the button, you will hear a sequence of sounds (almost 1 second long), separated by a short silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Your task is to count the number of tones you hear.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We will ask you for your answer after the whole sequence has played. <strong>The sounds will only be played once before you need to provide an answer</strong>, so please pay close attention. However, if you answer incorrectly, you will have a second chance to hear the sequence.
